# Be My Eye

An AI-powered voice assistant that helps blind and low-vision users understand and interact with their surroundings. Point a phone camera at a scene, ask a question out loud, and get a concise, natural spoken answer — powered by a Vision-Language Model, speech recognition, and text-to-speech, all orchestrated by a backend that keeps AI providers swappable behind stable interfaces.

> **Design philosophy:** conversation over image captioning. The assistant answers the user's *intent* ("Can I drink this?"), not just describes pixels ("a bottle is present").

## Key Features

- **Scene understanding** — "What's in front of me?" answered from the latest camera frame.
- **Object questions** — "Can I drink this?" answered with intent, not a generic description.
- **Currency reader** — one-tap **Money Mode** button tries a specialist Egyptian-banknote detector first (Roboflow-hosted, when configured), falling back to the general VLM; voice questions ("how much is this?") also route to the currency task.
- **Color detector** — "What color is this?" describes the color of an object.
- **Product identifier** — "What am I holding?" reads brand/label context from packaging.
- **Food identification** — "What am I eating?" names the dish and visible ingredients, with hedged dietary/allergen/nutrition notes.
- **People & social awareness** — "Is anyone in front of me?" describes count, orientation, and expression — never identifies who someone is.
- **Environment & safety cues** — "Is the light on?" reports lighting, brightness, and visible stove/burner state.
- **Clothing matching** — "Do my clothes match?" checks color coordination and visible stains.
- **Label reading** — "Has this expired?" reads expiry dates and medicine names from a label.
- **Barcode / product lookup** — one-tap barcode scan looks up product name, brand, ingredients, and allergens via Open Food Facts.
- **Object finder (grounding)** — "Where are my keys?" locates an object within the frame.
- **Text reading (OCR)** — "Read this page" extracts and reads visible text aloud.
- **Multi-turn conversation memory** — short-term history so follow-ups ("Is it open?") resolve naturally.
- **Fully voice-driven, bilingual** — spoken input in (English or Arabic), spoken response out, no typing required.
- **Egyptian-dialect voice, with an offline fallback** — real Egyptian-Arabic TTS when reachable; if cloud synthesis fails, the phone speaks the answer itself using its built-in offline Arabic voice, so the app is never silent.
- **Provider-based architecture** — every AI capability (ASR, Vision, OCR, LLM, TTS, Grounding, currency detection, product lookup) sits behind a stable interface, so any model or vendor can be swapped without touching application logic.

## Project Status

This is an active proof-of-concept. Be honest with yourself about what's real before you rely on it:

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Backend (FastAPI) | **Working, tested, deployed** — live on Vercel with real Groq providers |
| Backend test suite | **Green** — 110 passed, 1 skipped (real-mode smoke test is env-gated) |
| Mobile app (Flutter) | **Working** — full app implemented (capture, playback, conversation state, Money Mode, barcode scanning, Stitch-designed hold-to-ask screen), 28/28 tests passing, `flutter analyze` clean |
| Vision-task routing + grounding | **Working** — scene/currency/color/product/food/people/environment/clothing/label routing and object-finder grounding, with Arabic keyword support (this app's ASR defaults to Arabic), verified live end-to-end |
| `/conversation` end-to-end | **Fully verified live** — ASR → routing → Vision/OCR/Grounding → LLM → TTS all confirmed working against real Groq APIs |
| Egyptian currency detection | **Code complete, not live-verified** — `RoboflowCurrencyProvider` is written against Roboflow's documented REST contract but needs a free Roboflow account + API key to actually run; falls back to the general VLM until then (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)) |
| Egyptian TTS voice | **Working, live-verified** — calls a free, public Gradio Space for Egyptian-dialect speech; falls back to the phone's offline Arabic voice on failure |
| Product/barcode lookup | **Working, live-verified** — free Open Food Facts API, no account needed |
| CI/CD | **Set up** — GitHub Actions run backend `pytest` and mobile `flutter analyze && flutter test` on every PR; deploys remain manual via the Vercel CLI |

See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full phased plan and [`docs/superpowers/plans/`](docs/superpowers/plans/) for the detailed, task-by-task implementation plans driving this work.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- **Language:** Python 3.11+ (deployed with 3.13)
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **AI Provider:** [Groq](https://console.groq.com) — Vision-Language Model, Whisper (ASR), and LLM reasoning, all behind provider interfaces
- **Egyptian TTS:** [`gradio_client`](https://pypi.org/project/gradio-client/) calling a free, public Hugging Face Gradio Space
- **Currency detection:** [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) hosted inference (optional — falls back to the VLM without it)
- **Product lookup:** [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org) (free, no API key)
- **HTTP client:** `httpx` (product lookup, currency detection)
- **Validation:** Pydantic v2
- **Image handling:** Pillow
- **Server:** Uvicorn (local dev)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Python / Fluid Compute runtime)

**Mobile**
- **Framework:** Flutter (Dart SDK ≥3.8.0)
- **State management:** `provider` (`ChangeNotifier`-based `ConversationState`)
- **Camera:** `camera`
- **Barcode scanning:** `mobile_scanner`
- **Audio:** `record` (capture), `just_audio` (cloud-voice playback), `flutter_tts` (on-device Arabic fallback voice)
- **Networking:** `http`
- **Permissions:** `permission_handler`
- **Image compression:** `image`
- **Fonts:** `google_fonts`

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11 or higher** (backend)
- **A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys)** (for real AI responses; a fake-provider mode exists for development without one)
- **[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)** — `npm i -g vercel` (only needed if you're deploying)
- **Flutter SDK ≥3.8.0** — for the mobile app; not required to run the backend
- **Xcode or Android Studio** — for iOS Simulator / Android Emulator or physical-device testing (camera and microphone require real hardware; simulators/emulators have neither)

## Getting Started — Backend

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Aboalasaad/be-my-eye.git
cd be-my-eye
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

From the `backend/` directory:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs FastAPI, Groq's SDK, Pydantic, Pillow, Uvicorn, and pytest (via the `dev` extra defined in `pyproject.toml`).

### 3. Environment Setup (Optional — for Real AI Responses)

By default, the backend runs in **fake-provider mode**: every AI capability (ASR, Vision, OCR, LLM, TTS) returns deterministic, canned responses. This is enough to explore the API and run the full test suite without any credentials.

To use real Groq models, create a `.env` file at the **repository root** (checked by `backend/app/core/config.py`, which also checks `backend/.env` if run from that directory):

```bash
USE_REAL_PROVIDERS=true
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
```

See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below for the full list and defaults.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API is now available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Check it's alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### 5. Try the Conversation Endpoint

The backend exposes a single endpoint, `POST /conversation`, which accepts a base64-encoded image, base64-encoded audio, and a session ID, and returns a spoken response (also base64-encoded). See [`docs/API_SPEC.md`](docs/API_SPEC.md) for the full contract.

```bash
python3 -c "
import base64, io, json
from PIL import Image
buf = io.BytesIO()
Image.new('RGB', (32, 32), color='white').save(buf, format='PNG')
print(json.dumps({'image_base64': base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode()}))
" > /tmp/image_payload.json

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/conversation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "local-test",
    "image_base64": "'"$(python3 -c "
import base64, io
from PIL import Image
buf = io.BytesIO()
Image.new('RGB', (32, 32), color='white').save(buf, format='PNG')
print(base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode())
")"'",
    "audio_base64": "'"$(python3 -c "
import base64, io, wave
buf = io.BytesIO()
with wave.open(buf, 'wb') as w:
    w.setnchannels(1); w.setsampwidth(2); w.setframerate(16000)
    w.writeframes(b'\x00\x00' * 1600)
print(base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode())
")"'",
    "debug": true
  }'
```

With `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS` unset (the default), this returns deterministic fake-provider output instantly. With real providers configured, it calls Groq for ASR, Vision, LLM reasoning, and TTS.

## Getting Started — Mobile

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define=BACKEND_URL=https://backend-mu-azure-ghm6imsjg1.vercel.app
```

This runs the app against the deployed backend. To point at a local backend instead, run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` in `backend/` and pass `--dart-define=BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000` (use your machine's LAN IP, not `localhost`, when running on a physical device).

**Camera and microphone require real hardware.** The iOS Simulator and Android Emulator have neither — holding the "Hold to ask" button there shows "Could not access the camera" / "Could not start recording" errors, which is expected, not a bug. For a full test of the capture pipeline, run on a physical device:

```bash
flutter devices              # confirm your device is listed
flutter run -d <device-id> --dart-define=BACKEND_URL=https://backend-mu-azure-ghm6imsjg1.vercel.app
```

On iOS, a physical device needs a signing team configured in Xcode (`open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, then Signing & Capabilities) the first time you deploy to it.

## Architecture

Be My Eye is a **modular monolith**: one backend application with clearly separated internal components, one mobile client, and every AI capability accessed through a provider interface so implementations can be swapped without touching application logic. The backend — not the LLM — owns orchestration: it decides which providers to call; the LLM only reasons over the assembled context. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the full rationale.

```

### Request Lifecycle

1. Mobile app captures the current camera frame and records the user's spoken question.
2. A single `POST /conversation` request carries the session ID, image, and audio to the backend.
3. **ASR** (`GroqASRProvider` / `FakeASRProvider`) transcribes the audio to text.
4. **`IntentRouter`** inspects the transcript and decides which providers this request actually needs — e.g., a "read this" request routes to OCR in addition to Vision; a plain question routes to Vision alone.
5. Selected providers run: **Vision** analyzes the frame for the user's question; **OCR** extracts visible text if requested.
6. **LLM** (`GroqLLMProvider` / `FakeLLMProvider`) reasons over the transcript, provider outputs, and recent conversation history to produce one concise, natural response. The LLM never decides which providers to call — that's the backend's job, not an agentic loop.
7. **TTS** synthesizes the response text into speech.
8. The backend returns text, base64-encoded audio, and (in debug mode) which providers were selected and their raw outputs.
9. `ConversationService` records the turn in the session store so follow-up questions have context.

### Provider Interfaces

Every AI capability is an abstract base class in `backend/app/providers/base.py`:

| Provider | Responsibility | Fake Implementation | Real Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ASRProvider` | Speech → text | Deterministic fixed text | Groq Whisper |
| `VisionProvider` | Scene/question understanding | Deterministic summary | Groq Vision-Language Model |
| `OCRProvider` | Text extraction from images | Deterministic text | Delegates to the same Groq VLM |
| `LLMProvider` | Final response reasoning | Deterministic response | Groq LLM |
| `TTSProvider` | Text → speech | Deterministic UTF-8 bytes | `EgyptianTTSProvider` (Gradio Space) by default; `GroqTTSProvider` (Saudi voice) remains available as an alternate implementation |
| `GroundingProvider` | Object location ("where are my keys?") | Deterministic location string | Groq VLM |
| `CurrencyDetectionProvider` | Specialist Egyptian-currency detection | Deterministic confident result | `RoboflowCurrencyProvider` (only when `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` is set — otherwise `ConversationService` falls back to the VLM automatically) |
| `ProductLookupProvider` | Barcode → product name/ingredients/allergens | Deterministic sample product | Open Food Facts |

A response's speech synthesis can fail gracefully: `TTSUnavailableError` sets `tts_fallback_required: true` and empty `audio_base64` in the response, which the mobile client uses to speak the response text with the phone's own offline Arabic voice instead of failing silently.

Swapping any provider's implementation — a different vendor, a local model, a specialized OCR engine — never requires changing `ConversationService`, the API contract, or the mobile client. See [`docs/PROVIDERS.md`](docs/PROVIDERS.md).

## Environment Variables

All settings are read by `backend/app/core/config.py`. A `.env` file at the repository root (or inside `backend/`) is loaded automatically if present; environment variables always take precedence.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS` | `true` to call real Groq APIs; `false`/unset uses deterministic fakes | `false` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Your Groq API key — **required** when `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS=true` | *(none)* |
| `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL` | Groq vision-capable model ID — **required** when `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS=true`; the app refuses to start without it | *(none)* |
| `GROQ_LLM_MODEL` | Groq model for final response reasoning | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| `GROQ_ASR_MODEL` | Groq model for speech-to-text | `whisper-large-v3` |
| `GROQ_ASR_LANGUAGE` | ASR language hint | `ar` (Arabic) |
| `GROQ_TTS_MODEL` | Groq model for text-to-speech (used only if `EgyptianTTSProvider` is bypassed — see below) | `canopylabs/orpheus-arabic-saudi` |
| `GROQ_TTS_VOICE` | Groq TTS voice name | `abdullah` |
| `EGYPTIAN_TTS_SPACE_ID` | Hugging Face Space used for Egyptian-dialect speech (free, public, no API key) | `omarelshehy/NAMAA-Egyptian-Voice` |
| `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` | Enables the Egyptian-currency specialist detector for Money Mode and voice currency questions; **without it, currency questions fall back to the general VLM** — the app works fine either way | *(none)* |
| `ROBOFLOW_CURRENCY_PROJECT` | Roboflow project slug for the currency model (confirm via your account's "Get curl command") | `egyptian-currency-psnkr` |
| `ROBOFLOW_CURRENCY_VERSION` | Roboflow model version number | `1` |
| `BE_MY_EYE_APP_NAME` | FastAPI app title | `Be My Eye Backend` |
| `BE_MY_EYE_ENV` | Environment label | `development` |
| `BE_MY_EYE_DEBUG` | FastAPI debug mode | `true` |

> **Note on defaults:** the ASR language defaults to Arabic — this reflects the project's current target users. Override `GROQ_ASR_LANGUAGE` for other languages. The default TTS voice is now Egyptian-dialect (`EgyptianTTSProvider`, real-mode default in `create_app()`); `GroqTTSProvider`'s Saudi voice remains in the codebase as an alternate implementation of the same `TTSProvider` interface but isn't used by default.

### Enabling accurate Egyptian currency detection (optional, free)

Money Mode and voice currency questions work out of the box via the general VLM, but for the specialist detector's higher accuracy:

1. Create a free account at [roboflow.com](https://roboflow.com).
2. Find or fork the Egyptian currency model (e.g. the Banha University project on Roboflow Universe) into your own workspace.
3. Open its Deploy tab and use "Get curl command" to confirm the exact project slug, version number, and API key for your account.
4. Set `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` (and `ROBOFLOW_CURRENCY_PROJECT`/`ROBOFLOW_CURRENCY_VERSION` if they differ from the defaults above).

Until this is done, `currency_detector` stays unconfigured and every currency question uses the general VLM — identical to the app's behavior before this feature existed.

Never commit a `.env` file — it's already covered by `.gitignore`. On Vercel, set these as [project environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) (see [Deployment](#deployment)), not in `vercel.json`.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` | Start the backend dev server (run from `backend/`) |
| `python3 -m pytest -v` | Run the full backend test suite (run from `backend/`) |
| `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -v` | Run only unit tests |
| `python3 -m pytest tests/integration/ -v` | Run only integration tests |
| `RUN_REAL_GROQ_SMOKE_TESTS=true python3 -m pytest -v` | Include the real-mode Groq smoke test (needs `GROQ_API_KEY` + `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL`) |
| `python3 scripts/live_image_smoke.py` | Manual smoke-test script that hits real Groq with a sample image/question |
| `vercel dev` | Run the backend locally through Vercel's emulator (run from `backend/`, after `vercel link`) |
| `vercel deploy --prod` | Deploy the backend to Vercel production (run from `backend/`) |
| `vercel env ls production` | List configured production environment variables |

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pytest -v
```

Expected output: **110 passed, 1 skipped**. The one skip is `tests/integration/test_real_mode_smoke.py`, which only runs when `RUN_REAL_GROQ_SMOKE_TESTS=true` and a real `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL` are set — it makes real Groq API calls and isn't part of the default fast, deterministic suite.

```

### Writing Tests

Every production module has a corresponding unit test file — when you add a module, add its test file alongside it. Example pattern used throughout this codebase:

```python
from app.services.intent_router import IntentRouter

def test_intent_router_adds_ocr_for_text_requests():
    router = IntentRouter()
    result = router.select_providers("Can you read this receipt for me?")
    assert "ocr" in result
```

Mobile tests run via `flutter test` from `mobile/` (28 tests, all passing) and cover `ConversationState` (including Money Mode, barcode lookup, and the on-device TTS fallback), `BackendClient`, `MediaCaptureService`, `AudioPlaybackService`, response models, and the conversation screen's semantics, using fake implementations of each service. `flutter analyze` is clean with no issues.

## Deployment

The backend deploys to **Vercel** using its Python runtime (Fluid Compute). The `[tool.vercel]` entry in `backend/pyproject.toml` points Vercel directly at the existing `app.main:app` FastAPI instance — no wrapper file or directory restructuring needed.

### One-Time Setup

```bash
npm i -g vercel
cd backend

### Configure Production Environment Variables

Secrets are set via the Vercel CLI (interactively, so they never appear in shell history or command-line arguments) or the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard):

```bash
vercel env add USE_REAL_PROVIDERS production
# enter: true

vercel env add GROQ_API_KEY production
# paste your key when prompted

vercel env add GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL production
# enter your chosen Groq vision model ID
```

`EGYPTIAN_TTS_SPACE_ID` and `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` are optional — both have sensible defaults/fallbacks (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)) and don't need to be set for the app to work.

Verify:

```bash
vercel env ls production
```

### Deploy

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

Vercel builds using `backend/requirements.txt` (its Python builder needs this file explicitly — it does not read `pyproject.toml` dependencies) and `backend/.python-version` (pinned to `3.13`). On success, it prints a production URL and a stable alias URL; use the **alias URL** (not the unique per-deployment URL, which sits behind Vercel's SSO wall by default) as your `BACKEND_URL` for the mobile app.

### Verify the Deployment

```bash
curl https://your-alias-url.vercel.app/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### Local Verification Before Deploying

Always verify with Vercel's local emulator before pushing to production — it catches configuration errors (like an invalid `vercel.json` `functions` path) that only surface under Vercel's actual routing, not under plain `uvicorn`:

```bash
vercel dev
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions run tests on every push/PR, path-filtered so each workflow only runs when its area changes:

- [`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml) — `pytest` with fake providers (no secrets required), triggered on `backend/**` changes
- [`.github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml) — `flutter analyze && flutter test`, triggered on `mobile/**` changes

These workflows run tests only — they do not deploy anything. Deploys remain manual via the Vercel CLI (see [Deploy](#deploy) above). **Recommended next step (manual, one-time):** connect this GitHub repository to the Vercel project via the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) → Project Settings → Git, so pushes to `main` auto-deploy to production and PRs get preview URLs automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### `vercel.json` error: "doesn't match any Serverless Functions inside the api directory"

Vercel's `functions` key in `vercel.json` only accepts paths rooted at `api/` (or framework-specific directories) — it cannot reference a custom `[tool.vercel] entrypoint` path like `app/main.py` directly, even though entrypoint detection itself works fine. If you need to configure `maxDuration` or similar per-function settings, either omit the `functions` key (Vercel's platform default is currently 300s, generous for this app's ASR → Vision → LLM → TTS chain) or restructure under `api/`.

### `groq.BadRequestError: ... requires terms acceptance`

Some Groq models (notably the default TTS model, `canopylabs/orpheus-arabic-saudi`) require a one-time terms acceptance by the account/org admin. Visit the URL in the error message (or `https://console.groq.com/playground?model=<model-id>`) and accept the terms, then retry.

### `RuntimeError: GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL is required when real providers are enabled`

Set `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL` to a vision-capable model ID from your Groq account. The app deliberately refuses to start in real mode without it rather than failing confusingly later.

### Backend works locally but fails after deploying to Vercel

Check `vercel env ls production` — environment variables set locally in a `.env` file are **not** automatically available in production; they must be added via `vercel env add` (see [Deployment](#deployment)).

### `mobile/lib/main.dart` is gitignored / mobile changes aren't being tracked

The root `.gitignore` used to be a Python project template whose `lib/` pattern (intended for Python build output) also matched Flutter's `mobile/lib/` source directory, silently excluding Dart source from every commit. This was fixed by scoping `.gitignore` per language root (see decision [D-014](docs/DECISIONS.md)). If you still see this, check `git check-ignore -v mobile/lib/main.dart` — it should report no match. If it does match something, your local `.gitignore` may predate the fix; pull the latest `main`.

### "Hold to ask" shows "Could not access the camera" / "Could not start recording"

Expected on the iOS Simulator and Android Emulator — neither has a camera or microphone. Test on a physical device (see [Getting Started — Mobile](#getting-started--mobile)).
