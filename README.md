# Be My Eye

An AI-powered voice assistant that helps blind and low-vision users understand and interact with their surroundings. Point a phone camera at a scene, ask a question out loud, and get a concise, natural spoken answer — powered by a Vision-Language Model, speech recognition, and text-to-speech, all orchestrated by a backend that keeps AI providers swappable behind stable interfaces.

> **Design philosophy:** conversation over image captioning. The assistant answers the user's *intent* ("Can I drink this?"), not just describes pixels ("a bottle is present").

## Key Features

- **Scene understanding** — "What's in front of me?" answered from the latest camera frame.
- **Object questions** — "Can I drink this?" answered with intent, not a generic description.
- **Text reading (OCR)** — "Read this page" extracts and reads visible text aloud.
- **Multi-turn conversation memory** — short-term history so follow-ups ("Is it open?") resolve naturally.
- **Fully voice-driven** — spoken input in, spoken response out, no typing required.
- **Provider-based architecture** — every AI capability (ASR, Vision, OCR, LLM, TTS, and a Grounding placeholder for future object-location features) sits behind a stable interface, so any model or vendor can be swapped without touching application logic.

## Project Status

This is an active proof-of-concept. Be honest with yourself about what's real before you rely on it:

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Backend (FastAPI) | **Working, tested, deployed** — live on Vercel with real Groq providers |
| Backend test suite | **Green** — 32 passed, 1 skipped (real-mode smoke test is env-gated) |
| Mobile app (Flutter) | **Not yet implemented** — `mobile/lib/` does not exist in this repo. Only `mobile/test/` and `mobile/pubspec.yaml` exist; see [Known Issue](#known-issue-mobilelib-was-never-committed) below |
| TTS in production | **Partially verified** — `/conversation` works end-to-end through ASR → routing → Vision → LLM against real Groq APIs; the final TTS call is blocked on a one-time Groq account action (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) |
| CI/CD | **Not yet set up** — deploys are manual via the Vercel CLI today |

See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full phased plan and [`docs/superpowers/plans/`](docs/superpowers/plans/) for the detailed, task-by-task implementation plans driving this work.

### Known Issue: `mobile/lib/` Was Never Committed

The root `.gitignore` used to be a Python project template. Its `lib/` pattern (intended for Python build output) also matched Flutter's `mobile/lib/` **source directory**, so every historical commit to `mobile/` silently excluded the actual Dart source code — only test files survived. This has been fixed (see decision [D-014](docs/DECISIONS.md)): `.gitignore` is now scoped per language root, and `mobile/lib/` is trackable going forward. The Flutter app itself still needs to be (re)written; the committed test files in `mobile/test/` describe the intended API surface (`ConversationState`, `BackendClient`, `MediaCaptureService`, `AudioPlaybackService`, `DemoCapture`) for whoever picks that up.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- **Language:** Python 3.11+ (deployed with 3.13)
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **AI Provider:** [Groq](https://console.groq.com) — Vision-Language Model, Whisper (ASR), and TTS, all behind provider interfaces
- **Validation:** Pydantic v2
- **Image handling:** Pillow
- **Server:** Uvicorn (local dev)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Python / Fluid Compute runtime)

**Mobile** *(planned/in-progress — see [Project Status](#project-status))*
- **Framework:** Flutter (Dart SDK ≥3.8.0)
- **Camera:** `camera`, `image_picker`
- **Audio:** `record` (capture), `just_audio` (playback)
- **Networking:** `http`
- **Permissions:** `permission_handler`

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11 or higher** (backend)
- **A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys)** (for real AI responses; a fake-provider mode exists for development without one)
- **[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)** — `npm i -g vercel` (only needed if you're deploying)
- **Flutter SDK ≥3.8.0** — only once the mobile app is (re)implemented; not required to run the backend

## Getting Started — Backend

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Aboalasaad/be-my-eye.git
cd be-my-eye
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

From the `backend/` directory:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs FastAPI, Groq's SDK, Pydantic, Pillow, Uvicorn, and pytest (via the `dev` extra defined in `pyproject.toml`).

### 3. Environment Setup (Optional — for Real AI Responses)

By default, the backend runs in **fake-provider mode**: every AI capability (ASR, Vision, OCR, LLM, TTS) returns deterministic, canned responses. This is enough to explore the API and run the full test suite without any credentials.

To use real Groq models, create a `.env` file at the **repository root** (checked by `backend/app/core/config.py`, which also checks `backend/.env` if run from that directory):

```bash
USE_REAL_PROVIDERS=true
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
```

See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below for the full list and defaults.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API is now available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Check it's alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### 5. Try the Conversation Endpoint

The backend exposes a single endpoint, `POST /conversation`, which accepts a base64-encoded image, base64-encoded audio, and a session ID, and returns a spoken response (also base64-encoded). See [`docs/API_SPEC.md`](docs/API_SPEC.md) for the full contract.

```bash
python3 -c "
import base64, io, json
from PIL import Image
buf = io.BytesIO()
Image.new('RGB', (32, 32), color='white').save(buf, format='PNG')
print(json.dumps({'image_base64': base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode()}))
" > /tmp/image_payload.json

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/conversation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "local-test",
    "image_base64": "'"$(python3 -c "
import base64, io
from PIL import Image
buf = io.BytesIO()
Image.new('RGB', (32, 32), color='white').save(buf, format='PNG')
print(base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode())
")"'",
    "audio_base64": "'"$(python3 -c "
import base64, io, wave
buf = io.BytesIO()
with wave.open(buf, 'wb') as w:
    w.setnchannels(1); w.setsampwidth(2); w.setframerate(16000)
    w.writeframes(b'\x00\x00' * 1600)
print(base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode())
")"'",
    "debug": true
  }'
```

With `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS` unset (the default), this returns deterministic fake-provider output instantly. With real providers configured, it calls Groq for ASR, Vision, LLM reasoning, and TTS.

## Getting Started — Mobile

**The mobile app source does not exist in this repository yet** (see [Known Issue](#known-issue-mobilelib-was-never-committed)). Once `mobile/lib/` is implemented:

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define=BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.vercel.app
```

The committed tests in `mobile/test/` (`conversation_state_test.dart`, `demo_capture_test.dart`, `models_test.dart`) describe the intended structure and can guide (re)implementation — see the "Mobile architecture" section of [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-be-my-eye-mvp-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-be-my-eye-mvp-design.md) for the full planned file layout.

## Architecture

Be My Eye is a **modular monolith**: one backend application with clearly separated internal components, one mobile client, and every AI capability accessed through a provider interface so implementations can be swapped without touching application logic. The backend — not the LLM — owns orchestration: it decides which providers to call; the LLM only reasons over the assembled context. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the full rationale.

```

### Request Lifecycle

1. Mobile app captures the current camera frame and records the user's spoken question.
2. A single `POST /conversation` request carries the session ID, image, and audio to the backend.
3. **ASR** (`GroqASRProvider` / `FakeASRProvider`) transcribes the audio to text.
4. **`IntentRouter`** inspects the transcript and decides which providers this request actually needs — e.g., a "read this" request routes to OCR in addition to Vision; a plain question routes to Vision alone.
5. Selected providers run: **Vision** analyzes the frame for the user's question; **OCR** extracts visible text if requested.
6. **LLM** (`GroqLLMProvider` / `FakeLLMProvider`) reasons over the transcript, provider outputs, and recent conversation history to produce one concise, natural response. The LLM never decides which providers to call — that's the backend's job, not an agentic loop.
7. **TTS** synthesizes the response text into speech.
8. The backend returns text, base64-encoded audio, and (in debug mode) which providers were selected and their raw outputs.
9. `ConversationService` records the turn in the session store so follow-up questions have context.

### Provider Interfaces

Every AI capability is an abstract base class in `backend/app/providers/base.py`:

| Provider | Responsibility | Fake Implementation | Real Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ASRProvider` | Speech → text | Deterministic fixed text | Groq Whisper |
| `VisionProvider` | Scene/question understanding | Deterministic summary | Groq Vision-Language Model |
| `OCRProvider` | Text extraction from images | Deterministic text | Delegates to the same Groq VLM |
| `LLMProvider` | Final response reasoning | Deterministic response | Groq LLM |
| `TTSProvider` | Text → speech | Deterministic UTF-8 bytes | Groq TTS |
| `GroundingProvider` | Object location (future capability) | — | Groq VLM (adapter exists; not yet wired into the conversation flow) |

Swapping any provider's implementation — a different vendor, a local model, a specialized OCR engine — never requires changing `ConversationService`, the API contract, or the mobile client. See [`docs/PROVIDERS.md`](docs/PROVIDERS.md).

## Environment Variables

All settings are read by `backend/app/core/config.py`. A `.env` file at the repository root (or inside `backend/`) is loaded automatically if present; environment variables always take precedence.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS` | `true` to call real Groq APIs; `false`/unset uses deterministic fakes | `false` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Your Groq API key — **required** when `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS=true` | *(none)* |
| `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL` | Groq vision-capable model ID — **required** when `USE_REAL_PROVIDERS=true`; the app refuses to start without it | *(none)* |
| `GROQ_LLM_MODEL` | Groq model for final response reasoning | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| `GROQ_ASR_MODEL` | Groq model for speech-to-text | `whisper-large-v3` |
| `GROQ_ASR_LANGUAGE` | ASR language hint | `ar` (Arabic) |
| `GROQ_TTS_MODEL` | Groq model for text-to-speech | `canopylabs/orpheus-arabic-saudi` |
| `GROQ_TTS_VOICE` | TTS voice name | `abdullah` |
| `BE_MY_EYE_APP_NAME` | FastAPI app title | `Be My Eye Backend` |
| `BE_MY_EYE_ENV` | Environment label | `development` |
| `BE_MY_EYE_DEBUG` | FastAPI debug mode | `true` |

> **Note on defaults:** the ASR language and TTS voice default to Arabic — this reflects the project's current target users. Override `GROQ_ASR_LANGUAGE`/`GROQ_TTS_MODEL`/`GROQ_TTS_VOICE` for other languages.

Never commit a `.env` file — it's already covered by `.gitignore`. On Vercel, set these as [project environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) (see [Deployment](#deployment)), not in `vercel.json`.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` | Start the backend dev server (run from `backend/`) |
| `python3 -m pytest -v` | Run the full backend test suite (run from `backend/`) |
| `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -v` | Run only unit tests |
| `python3 -m pytest tests/integration/ -v` | Run only integration tests |
| `RUN_REAL_GROQ_SMOKE_TESTS=true python3 -m pytest -v` | Include the real-mode Groq smoke test (needs `GROQ_API_KEY` + `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL`) |
| `python3 scripts/live_image_smoke.py` | Manual smoke-test script that hits real Groq with a sample image/question |
| `vercel dev` | Run the backend locally through Vercel's emulator (run from `backend/`, after `vercel link`) |
| `vercel deploy --prod` | Deploy the backend to Vercel production (run from `backend/`) |
| `vercel env ls production` | List configured production environment variables |

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pytest -v
```

Expected output: **32 passed, 1 skipped**. The one skip is `tests/integration/test_real_mode_smoke.py`, which only runs when `RUN_REAL_GROQ_SMOKE_TESTS=true` and a real `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL` are set — it makes real Groq API calls and isn't part of the default fast, deterministic suite.

```

### Writing Tests

Every production module has a corresponding unit test file — when you add a module, add its test file alongside it. Example pattern used throughout this codebase:

```python
from app.services.intent_router import IntentRouter

def test_intent_router_adds_ocr_for_text_requests():
    router = IntentRouter()
    result = router.select_providers("Can you read this receipt for me?")
    assert "ocr" in result
```

Mobile tests (once `mobile/lib/` exists) run via `flutter test` from `mobile/`; the existing `mobile/test/` files already define the expected behavior for `ConversationState`, `BackendClient`, `MediaCaptureService`, and `AudioPlaybackService` using fake implementations of each.

## Deployment

The backend deploys to **Vercel** using its Python runtime (Fluid Compute). The `[tool.vercel]` entry in `backend/pyproject.toml` points Vercel directly at the existing `app.main:app` FastAPI instance — no wrapper file or directory restructuring needed.

### One-Time Setup

```bash
npm i -g vercel
cd backend
vercel login
vercel link --yes
```

### Configure Production Environment Variables

Secrets are set via the Vercel CLI (interactively, so they never appear in shell history or command-line arguments) or the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard):

```bash
vercel env add USE_REAL_PROVIDERS production
# enter: true

vercel env add GROQ_API_KEY production
# paste your key when prompted

vercel env add GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL production
# enter your chosen Groq vision model ID
```

Verify:

```bash
vercel env ls production
```

### Deploy

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

Vercel builds using `backend/requirements.txt` (its Python builder needs this file explicitly — it does not read `pyproject.toml` dependencies) and `backend/.python-version` (pinned to `3.13`). On success, it prints a production URL and a stable alias URL; use the **alias URL** (not the unique per-deployment URL, which sits behind Vercel's SSO wall by default) as your `BACKEND_URL` for the mobile app.

### Verify the Deployment

```bash
curl https://your-alias-url.vercel.app/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### Local Verification Before Deploying

Always verify with Vercel's local emulator before pushing to production — it catches configuration errors (like an invalid `vercel.json` `functions` path) that only surface under Vercel's actual routing, not under plain `uvicorn`:

```bash
vercel dev
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### CI/CD

Not yet implemented. The plan (see [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-be-my-eye-mvp-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-be-my-eye-mvp-design.md), Section 4.6) calls for GitHub Actions running `pytest` (backend) and `flutter analyze && flutter test` (mobile) on every PR, plus Vercel's native Git integration for automatic preview/production deploys — connecting the GitHub repo to the Vercel project via the dashboard is a one-time manual step when that's implemented.

## Troubleshooting

### `vercel.json` error: "doesn't match any Serverless Functions inside the api directory"

Vercel's `functions` key in `vercel.json` only accepts paths rooted at `api/` (or framework-specific directories) — it cannot reference a custom `[tool.vercel] entrypoint` path like `app/main.py` directly, even though entrypoint detection itself works fine. If you need to configure `maxDuration` or similar per-function settings, either omit the `functions` key (Vercel's platform default is currently 300s, generous for this app's ASR → Vision → LLM → TTS chain) or restructure under `api/`.

### `groq.BadRequestError: ... requires terms acceptance`

Some Groq models (notably the default TTS model, `canopylabs/orpheus-arabic-saudi`) require a one-time terms acceptance by the account/org admin. Visit the URL in the error message (or `https://console.groq.com/playground?model=<model-id>`) and accept the terms, then retry.

### `RuntimeError: GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL is required when real providers are enabled`

Set `GROQ_MULTIMODAL_MODEL` to a vision-capable model ID from your Groq account. The app deliberately refuses to start in real mode without it rather than failing confusingly later.

### Backend works locally but fails after deploying to Vercel

Check `vercel env ls production` — environment variables set locally in a `.env` file are **not** automatically available in production; they must be added via `vercel env add` (see [Deployment](#deployment)).

### `mobile/lib/main.dart` is gitignored / mobile changes aren't being tracked

This was a real historical bug (see [Known Issue](#known-issue-mobilelib-was-never-committed)) and is now fixed. If you still see this, check `git check-ignore -v mobile/lib/main.dart` — it should report no match. If it does match something, your local `.gitignore` may predate the fix; pull the latest `main`.
